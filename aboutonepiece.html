<p><b>One Piece</b>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated
by <i>Eiichiro Oda</i>. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly 
Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 104
tankōbon volumes as of November 2022.<p> The story follows the adventures of 
<u>Monkey D. Luffy</u>, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after
unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,
Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the deceased <em>King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's</em>
ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order <u>to become the next King of the Pirates</u>.<br>

Dominating the world's surface is the Blue Sea, a body of saltwater broadly divided into quadrants: the East Blue, the West Blue, the North Blue, and the South Blue. These divisions are formed by two natural barriers that bisect the world at roughly perpendicular angles:
<br>
<ul>
<li>The Grand Line, a relatively narrow strip of ocean infamous for its unnatural, rapidly-shifting climates and monstrous wildlife—as well as being enclosed by the completely wind- and current-free Calm Belt regions.
<li>The Red Line, a huge (and mostly barren) landmass that functions as the world's only true continent.
